# MIT Systems Engineering Reference for Manufacturing

## When To Use
- Need system architecture principles for manufacturing cell design
- Applying requirements engineering to process planning specifications
- Designing complex multi-operation machining sequences
- Understanding V-model verification for manufacturing system validation

## How To Use
```
prism_knowledge action=search params={
  query: "systems engineering requirements architecture V-model integration",
  registries: ["formulas", "courses"]
}
```

## What It Returns
- Requirements decomposition methods for prism_intelligence genplan_plan
- Architecture trade study frameworks for prism_toolpath strategy_select
- V-model verification stages for prism_omega validate quality gates
- System integration patterns for prism_intelligence genplan_operations sequencing

## Key Course Mappings
- **MIT 16.842** (Fundamentals of SE): Requirements, V-model, verification -> genplan_plan, omega validate
- **MIT ESD.34** (System Architecture): Decomposition, modularity, DSM -> genplan_setups, strategy_select
- **MIT 6.033** (Computer Systems): Abstraction, naming, fault tolerance -> controller_optimize, dnc_generate

## Examples
- **Process planning**: Use 16.842 requirements flow via prism_intelligence genplan_plan for part routing
- **Setup optimization**: Apply ESD.34 DSM clustering via prism_intelligence genplan_setups for fixturing
- **Strategy selection**: Use ESD.34 trade studies via prism_toolpath strategy_select for feature types
- **Validation gates**: Apply 16.842 V-model via prism_omega validate at each manufacturing stage
- **Fault tolerance**: Use 6.033 redundancy principles for prism_intelligence genplan_risk mitigation
