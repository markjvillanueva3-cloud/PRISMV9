# MIT Human Factors & HMI Reference for Manufacturing

## When To Use
- Need operator interface design principles for CNC control panels
- Applying cognitive load theory to alarm management and display design
- Designing setup sheets and work instructions for shop floor clarity
- Understanding human supervisory control for automated machining cells

## How To Use
```
prism_knowledge action=search params={
  query: "human factors cognitive load alarm design operator interface HMI",
  registries: ["formulas", "courses"]
}
```

## What It Returns
- Cognitive load principles for prism_intelligence setup_sheet layout design
- Alarm hierarchy frameworks for prism_intelligence mobile_alarm prioritization
- Display design guidelines for prism_intelligence shop_dashboard information density
- Supervisory control models for adaptive automation trust calibration

## Key Course Mappings
- **MIT 16.400** (Human Factors Eng): Cognition, displays, controls, ergonomics -> setup_sheet, mobile_*
- **MIT 16.422** (Human Supervisory Control): Automation levels, trust, situation awareness -> adaptive_*

## Examples
- **Setup sheet design**: Apply 16.400 information hierarchy via prism_intelligence setup_sheet for clarity
- **Alarm management**: Use 16.400 alarm prioritization via prism_intelligence mobile_alarm for ISA 18.2
- **Dashboard layout**: Apply 16.400 proximity compatibility via prism_intelligence shop_dashboard
- **Automation trust**: Use 16.422 levels of automation for prism_intelligence adaptive_override boundaries
- **Voice interface**: Apply 16.400 auditory display principles via prism_intelligence mobile_voice for hands-free
