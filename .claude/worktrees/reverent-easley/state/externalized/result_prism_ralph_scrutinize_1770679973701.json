{"validator":"CODE_REVIEWER","findings":"## Code Review Findings\n\n### CRITICAL Issues\n1. **C1: Missing Dispatcher Types in Telemetry** - CONFIRMED\n   - `KNOWN_DISPATCHERS` Set missing `prism_pfp` and `prism_memory`\n   - Impact: Telemetry corruption, anomaly detection failures\n   - Fix: Add missing entries to Set in TelemetryEngine.ts lines 74-87\n\n### HIGH Priority Issues  \n2. **H3: DAG Cycle Detection** - REQUIRES VERIFICATION\n   - Spec indicates cycle detection with visited set is required\n   - Memory graph traversal could cause infinite loops without proper cycle detection\n   - Need to verify MemoryGraphEngine.ts implements visited set tracking\n\n3. **H4: WAL Flush Error Handling** - REQUIRES VERIFICATION\n   - Write-Ahead Log failures could corrupt memory graph state\n   - Need to verify proper error handling and rollback mechanisms in MemoryGraphEngine.ts\n\n### MEDIUM Priority Issues\n4. **Pre-build Action Validation** - CONFIRMED\n   - contextDispatcher ACTIONS array missing 4 action cases\n   - Could cause runtime errors for unhandled action types\n   - Description/action count mismatches in 4 dispatchers indicate maintenance issues\n\n### LOW Priority Issues  \n5. **C3: Private Key Exposure** - ARCHITECTURE OK, NEEDS SCAN\n   - Current architecture correctly separates private keys from certificate responses\n   - Recommendation: Code scan to ensure no accidental private key leakage in dispatcher responses\n\n### FALSE POSITIVES\n- **M4: Session Boot Race Condition** - Node.js single-threaded nature prevents race conditions in same process\n\n### Missing Analysis Areas\n- **Type Safety**: No explicit type checking validation performed on dispatcher interfaces\n- **Error Boundaries**: Limited analysis of error propagation between dispatcher layers  \n- **Edge Cases**: Insufficient validation of null/undefined handling in telemetry processing\n\n### SCORE: 0.65\n- **Reasoning**: One critical telemetry bug, two high-priority verification items, moderate technical debt in action validation. System appears functionally sound but needs verification of key safety mechanisms.\n\n**Immediate Action Required**: Fix C1 dispatcher registration before next deployment.","timestamp":"2026-02-09T23:32:53.527Z"}
