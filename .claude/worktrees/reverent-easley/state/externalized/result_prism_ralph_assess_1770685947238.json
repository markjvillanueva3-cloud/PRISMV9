{"assessment":"## Production Readiness Assessment: autoHookWrapper.ts\n\n### 1. Letter Grade: **C**\n\n### 2. Component Scores:\n- **R (Reasoning): 65/100** - Recovery approach is reactive rather than proactive; buffer zone changes lack clear rationale\n- **C (Code): 70/100** - Build succeeds and exports preserved, but recovery from bundle suggests architectural issues\n- **P (Process): 55/100** - Ad-hoc fixes without apparent testing or validation strategy\n- **S (Safety): 45/100** - Removal of hard limits without replacement safeguards is concerning\n- **L (Learning): 60/100** - Some learning evident in moving to advisory model, but incomplete\n\n### 3. Ω(x) Score: **56.5/100**\n```\nΩ(x) = 0.25(65) + 0.20(70) + 0.15(55) + 0.30(45) + 0.10(60) = 56.5\n```\n\n### 4. Production Readiness: **NOT_READY**\n\n### 5. Key Findings and Recommendations:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **Safety Regression**: Removing hard limits (500B/2KB caps) without replacement controls creates unbounded resource consumption risk\n2. **Recovery Pattern**: \"Recovered from bundle\" suggests improper deployment or version control issues\n3. **Threshold Arbitrariness**: Jump from 30 to 41+ calls for advisory lacks justification\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Immediate Actions:**\n   - Implement graduated limits (soft → hard) instead of advisory-only\n   - Add telemetry to monitor actual pressure patterns\n   - Document the rationale for 41+ threshold\n\n2. **Before Production:**\n   - Establish proper source control to avoid bundle recovery scenarios\n   - Create comprehensive test suite for pressure scenarios\n   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for resource protection\n   - Add configurable limits with sensible defaults\n\n3. **Architecture Review:**\n   - Evaluate why import restructuring was needed\n   - Consider modularizing pressure management into dedicated service\n   - Implement proper monitoring and alerting for resource usage\n\n**Minimum Requirements for CONDITIONAL status:**\n- Restore some form of hard limits at reasonable thresholds\n- Add basic integration tests\n- Document configuration and thresholds\n- Implement basic monitoring hooks","timestamp":"2026-02-10T01:12:27.080Z","model":"claude-opus-4-20250514"}
