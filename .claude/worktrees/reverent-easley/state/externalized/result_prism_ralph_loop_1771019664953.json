Safety should be integrated throughout all phases, not confined to one early phase with 8.3% of total effort.\n\n4. **No specification of \"Safety test matrix\" content**: What specific safety scenarios are tested? Tool breakage detection? Spindle overload? Collision detection? Emergency stop validation? Feedrate limit enforcement?\n\n5. **Production readiness (R5) has only 5 microsessions with no explicit safety verification gates**: Moving to production without documented final safety audit, safety regression testing, or operator safety training validation.\n\n## HIGH\n1. **\"All work in mcp-server\" - Single point of failure**: No mention of redundancy, failsafe mechanisms, or what happens if mcp-server crashes during active machining operations.\n\n2. **No operator safety risk assessment**: No mention of operator training requirements, safety interlocks, emergency procedures, or human factors analysis across any phase.\n\n3. **\"Registry resurrection\" implies working with legacy/archived data**: Resurrecting old registry data without validation could reintroduce previously deprecated unsafe parameters or obsolete tooling specifications.\n\n4. **No mention of safety parameter validation in data campaigns (R3 - 12 MS)**: Data campaigns are 25% of project effort, but no specification of safety bounds checking for cutting parameters, speeds, feeds, or depth of cut limits.\n\n5. **Visual platform (R5) developed without explicit safety display requirements**: No mention of mandatory safety status indicators, alarm visualization, or critical parameter monitoring in operator interface.\n\n## MEDIUM\n1. **Enterprise foundation (R4) has no specified safety audit trails**: No mention of logging safety-critical parameter changes, approval workflows for dangerous operations, or compliance documentation.\n\n2. **No version control safety strategy**: When \"replacing v10.0\", what happens to safety validations already passed in v10.0?

Component Scores\n\n| Component | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **R (Reasoning)** | 0.82 | Strategic pivot from platform migration to enhancement-in-place is well-reasoned. Phased decomposition into 48 microsessions across 6 phases shows disciplined work breakdown. However, the rationale for discarding the prism-platform migration path is stated but not evidenced — no decision log, trade-off matrix, or risk comparison was provided. |\n| **C (Code)** | 0.71 | All work consolidated in `mcp-server` simplifies the codebase surface, which is good. But no code artifacts, architecture diagrams, interface contracts, or dependency maps were submitted for review. The CODE_REVIEWER validator would have limited material to assess. Score reflects structural intent minus verification gap. |\n| **P (Process)** | 0.78 | 6-phase lifecycle with clear phase gates (R1→R6) is solid process design. 48 microsessions suggest manageable scope units. Critical concern: R1 registry resurrection is declared a **zero-float critical path blocker** but no contingency plan, fallback path, or buffer allocation is documented. A single-point-of-failure on the critical path without mitigation is a process-maturity gap. |\n| **S (Safety)** | 0.85 | Retention of the safety test matrix (R2, 4 microsessions) as a dedicated early phase is a strong signal. SAFETY_AUDITOR validation was invoked. The adaptation of enterprise specs to the enhancement path rather than building net-new reduces regression risk. Deduction: no explicit rollback strategy or blast-radius analysis was included for the enhancement-in-place approach, which inherently carries higher mutation risk than a clean migration. |\n| **L (Learning)** | 0.74 | The v10→v11 pivot itself demonstrates organizational learning (abandoning a failing migration strategy). However, no retrospective artifacts, lessons-learned capture, or feedback loops between phases are documented. The roadmap is forward-looking but doesn't encode how it will learn from itself during execution. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Production Readiness Verdict\n\n# **CONDITIONAL**\n\n### Conditions for READY promotion:\n\n| # | Condition | Priority | Phase Gate |\n|---|-----------|----------|------------|\n| 1 | **R1 Critical Path Mitigation Plan** — Document contingency/fallback for registry resurrection failure. Zero-float items without mitigation are deployment blockers. | **P0 — BLOCKING** | Before R1 execution |\n| 2 | **Rollback Strategy for Enhancement-in-Place** — Define blast radius, rollback triggers, and recovery procedures for in-situ mutations to `mcp-server`. | **P0 — BLOCKING** | Before R1 execution |\n| 3 | **Architecture Contract Artifacts** — Submit interface definitions, dependency graph, and integration points for CODE_REVIEWER validation. | **P1 — HIGH** | Before R3 (Data Campaigns) |\n| 4 | **Decision Log for v10→v11 Pivot** — Formalize the trade-off analysis that led to discarding platform migration. This is audit trail debt. | **P1 — HIGH** | Parallel to R1 |\n| 5 | **Inter-Phase Feedback Loops** — Define retrospective checkpoints and learning capture mechanisms between phases. | **P2 — MEDIUM** | Before R4 |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Findings & Recommendations\n\n### ✅ Strengths\n- **Strategic clarity**: Enhancement-in-place over migration reduces coordination overhead and preserves production continuity\n- **Safety-first sequencing**: Safety matrix in R2 (early) rather than R5/R6 (late) shows mature risk posture\n- **Granular decomposition**: 48 microsessions across 6 phases enables incremental validation and reduces batch-failure risk\n- **Scope consolidation**: Single-repo (`mcp-server`) approach eliminates cross-repo sync failures\n\n### ⚠️ Risks\n- **Single Point of Failure**: Registry resurrection as zero-float critical path with no documented mitigation is the highest-severity finding in this assessment\n- **Mutation Risk**: Enhancement-in-place inherently mutates production-path code; without rollback scaffolding this is a latent safety concern\n- **Validator Coverage Gap**: Three validators were invoked but no validator output artifacts were attached — assessment relies on declared validation rather than evidenced validation\n\n### 🔧 Recommendations\n\n1. **Immediately** draft an R1 failure-mode analysis with at minimum two fallback options\n2. **Establish** a canary or shadow-mode deployment strategy for the first 3 phases before committing mutations to the main execution path\n3. **Attach** validator output artifacts to future submissions — declared validation without evidence is an anti-pattern\n4. **Consider** adding 2 buffer microsessions to R1 (registry resurrection) given its zero-float designation; zero-float on a 7-microsession critical path in Phase 1 is structurally fragile\n\n---\n\n> **Assessor Summary**: This is a well-structured roadmap with sound strategic reasoning and strong safety posture. The CONDITIONAL verdict is driven entirely by the unmitigated critical-path risk in R1 and the absence of rollback architecture for the enhancement-in-place approach. Resolve the two P0 conditions and this advances to **READY** with a projected Ω(x) ≥ 0.85.","timestamp":"2026-02-13T21:54:24.950Z","model":"claude-opus-4-6"}}],"api_calls":6}
