{"assessment":"## PRISM F8 Compliance-as-Code Assessment\n\n### Grade: A-\n\n### Component Scores:\n- **R(reasoning): 92** - Excellent regulatory mapping with clear citations, smart conflict resolution, and appropriate disclaimers\n- **C(code): 88** - Well-structured interfaces, clear data models, but missing some implementation details\n- **P(process): 90** - Strong audit cadence, clear deployment flow, good failure handling\n- **S(safety): 94** - Exceptional safety design with immutable audit logs, defense-in-depth, and compliance hook protection\n- **L(learning): 85** - Good self-monitoring metrics, but could use more adaptive compliance learning\n\n### Ω(x) = 91.1\n\n### Production Readiness: READY\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Regulatory Rigor** - Every requirement cites specific clauses with proper disclaimers about expert review\n2. **Safety Architecture** - Compliance hooks protected from auto-rollback, audit logs immutable, MAX/TRUE conflict resolution\n3. **Multi-Framework Support** - Clean handling of overlapping requirements across 6 major frameworks\n4. **Audit Integrity** - 25-call cadence with gap detection and immutability guarantees\n5. **Graceful Degradation** - Existing compliance continues even if F8 fails\n\n**Areas of Excellence:**\n- The DISCLAIMER approach and reviewed_by requirements show mature understanding of liability\n- Conflict resolution rules (MAX/TRUE/INTERSECT) are well-reasoned for compliance contexts\n- Protection of compliance hooks from silent failure is critical for regulated environments\n\n**Minor Gaps:**\n1. **Hook Validation** - How are compliance hooks validated before deployment?\n2. **Rollback Strategy** - What happens if a compliance template needs emergency removal?\n3. **Cross-Framework Dependencies** - Some frameworks may have prerequisite relationships\n4. **Audit Trail Format** - Specific structure for regulatory inspection not detailed\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n1. **Add Hook Validation Stage**\n   ```typescript\n   interface ComplianceHookValidation {\n     dry_run_results: ValidationResult[]\n     simulated_violations: ComplianceViolation[]\n     impact_analysis: string[]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement Emergency Override**\n   - Add break-glass procedure for compliance template removal with executive approval\n   - Log all emergency actions with justification\n\n3. **Framework Dependencies**\n   ```typescript\n   dependencies?: string[] // e.g., FDA_21CFR11 might require ISO_13485\n   ```\n\n4. **Enhance Audit Trail Structure**\n   ```typescript\n   interface RegulatoryAuditEntry {\n     who: string\n     what: string\n     when: string\n     why: string\n     where: string\n     hash: string // cryptographic proof\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Add Compliance Drift Detection**\n   - Monitor for gradual deviation from compliance baselines\n   - Alert on trending violations before critical thresholds\n\n6. **Version Control Integration**\n   - Track all template changes in version control\n   - Require peer review for template modifications\n\n### Production Deployment Notes:\n- Start with single framework pilot (recommend ISO 13485)\n- Require legal/compliance team sign-off on each template\n- Establish template review board meeting quarterly\n- Consider regulatory sandbox mode for testing\n\nThis system demonstrates exceptional understanding of compliance requirements in manufacturing contexts. The safety-first design and clear boundaries of automated vs. expert responsibility make it suitable for production deployment in regulated environments.","timestamp":"2026-02-09T17:31:49.216Z","model":"claude-opus-4-20250514"}
