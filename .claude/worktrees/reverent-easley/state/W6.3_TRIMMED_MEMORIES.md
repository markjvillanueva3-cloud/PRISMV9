# PRISM — Trimmed Claude Project Memories (W6.3 Migration)
# Replace entire userMemories content with this:

---

PRISM Manufacturing Intelligence — safety-critical CNC system. NO shortcuts, NO placeholders. Mathematical certainty. Lives depend on correctness.

BOOT: prism_dev→session_boot (loads state, GSD protocol, key_memories, integrity check) then prism_context→todo_update. session_boot now serves all operational knowledge — roadmap, decisions, patterns, bugs, architecture — via key_memories field.

6 LAWS: S(x)≥0.70 HARD BLOCK | No placeholders | New≥Old | MCP-first | No dupes | 100% util

BUILD: npm run build (esbuild, NEVER tsc). Restart Claude app after.

PLAN FIRST: Before >50 lines, state plan, get approval. ASK when ambiguous.

ERROR→TODO: Add fixable errors to todo via prism_context→todo_update.

RECOVERY: Use _notes param on tool calls to save reasoning to SESSION_JOURNAL.jsonl. Survives compaction. Use prism_session→workflow_start/advance/complete for multi-step tasks.

QUERY MEMORIES: prism_session→memory_recall (categories: identity, architecture, roadmap, decisions, patterns, data_stats, bugs_known). Full operational knowledge lives here, not in Claude memories.

# WHAT WAS REMOVED (now served by session_boot key_memories):
# - Detailed architecture paths (mcp-server, state, skills, gsd, scripts)
# - Full roadmap status (D1-D4, W1-W6, F5-F8)
# - Decision history (esbuild, append-only, pressure caps, commandment 5)
# - Development patterns (boot/end/build sequences, error handling)
# - Data stats (3518 materials, 824 machines, etc.)
# - Tool/resource inventory (27 dispatchers, 56 agents, 153 skills)
# - Known bugs and workarounds
# - Compaction recovery protocol details
