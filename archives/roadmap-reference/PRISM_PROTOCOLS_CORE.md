# PRISM_PROTOCOLS_CORE.md - SPLIT INTO 3 FILES (2026-02-17)
# Per Roadmap Audit Finding 1+14: 2,186 lines was a token bomb.
# Original archived at: _archived_PRISM_PROTOCOLS_CORE_pre_split.md

# LOAD THESE INSTEAD:
# EVERY SESSION:  PRISM_PROTOCOLS_BOOT.md    (723 lines - laws, boot, recovery)
# CALC PHASES:    PRISM_PROTOCOLS_SAFETY.md   (804 lines - schemas, tolerances)
# IMPL PHASES:    PRISM_PROTOCOLS_CODING.md   (553 lines - code standards, build)
# NEVER LOAD:     PRISM_PROTOCOLS_CHANGELOG.md (138 lines - version history only)

# If you're reading this file, you should be loading one of the above instead.
# The original monolithic file caused 67% token waste per session.
