## Physics Models

### Kienzle Cutting Force Model

```
Fc = kc1.1 × h^(-mc) × b × Kγ × Kv × Kver

Where:
  Fc    = Cutting force (N)
  kc1.1 = Specific cutting force at h=1mm, b=1mm (N/mm²)
  h     = Chip thickness (mm)
  mc    = Kienzle exponent (typically 0.17-0.35)
  b     = Width of cut (mm)
  Kγ    = Rake angle correction
  Kv    = Speed correction
  Kver  = Wear correction
```

### Taylor Tool Life Equation

```
V × T^n = C

Where:
  V = Cutting speed (m/min or SFM)
  T = Tool life (minutes)
  n = Taylor exponent (material/tool dependent)
  C = Taylor constant
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Excessive tool wear | Speed too high | Reduce cutting speed 15-20% |
| Poor surface finish | Feed too high or tool worn | Reduce feed, check tool |
| Built-up edge | Speed too low, wrong geometry | Increase speed, use positive rake |
| Chatter | DOC too deep, poor rigidity | Reduce DOC, check setup |
| Chip control issues | Wrong chip breaker | Select appropriate chip breaker |
