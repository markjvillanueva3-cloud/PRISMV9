## UTILIZATION MAPPING FORMAT

Each skill gets a mapping table:

```markdown
### SKILL: prism-[name]

| Consumer | Uses | Trigger |
|----------|------|---------|
| Consumer 1 | Function X | When Y happens |
| Consumer 2 | Function Z | During W task |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Total Consumers:** N
**Utilization:** 100%
```
