# PRISM SKILL COMPLETION ROADMAP
## Micro-Session Plan for 100% Skill Utilization
**Created:** January 23, 2026

# GAP ANALYSIS

## Container Skills (Currently Available: 10)
These are in `/mnt/skills/user/` and usable NOW:
```
✅ prism-auditor

✅ prism-extractor
✅ prism-hierarchy-manager
✅ prism-knowledge-base
✅ prism-python-tools
✅ prism-state-manager
✅ prism-swarm-orchestrator
✅ prism-utilization
```

## Local Skills (On C: Drive: 48+)
These exist locally but need to be synced to container:

❌ prism-session-handoff
❌ prism-task-continuity
❌ prism-tdd
❌ prism-tool-selector
❌ prism-unit-converter
❌ prism-validator
❌ prism-verification
```

## Enhancements Still Pending (From Plan)
```
⏳ prism-algorithm-selector     ← NEW (not created yet)
⏳ Enhance prism-state-manager  ← Auto-checkpoints
⏳ Enhance prism-session-handoff← Essence format
⏳ Enhance prism-extractor      ← Pattern recognition
⏳ prism-code-analyzer          ← NEW (not created yet)

# MICRO-SESSION ROADMAP

## Phase 1: Skill Sync (3 Sessions)
**Goal:** Get all local skills into container format

### Session SKL-1.1: Priority Skills Sync
**Scope:** Verify/update 10 highest-impact skills
```
□ prism-context-dna
□ prism-context-pressure  
□ prism-coding-patterns
□ prism-quick-start
□ prism-large-file-writer
□ prism-session-handoff
□ prism-task-continuity
□ prism-material-templates
□ prism-validator
□ prism-extraction-index
```
**Output:** Updated skills ready for upload

### Session SKL-1.2: Expert Skills Sync
**Scope:** Verify/update 10 expert domain skills
```
□ prism-expert-cam-programmer
□ prism-expert-master-machinist
□ prism-expert-materials-scientist
□ prism-expert-post-processor
□ prism-expert-cad-expert
□ prism-expert-mechanical-engineer
□ prism-expert-mathematics
□ prism-expert-thermodynamics
□ prism-expert-quality-control
□ prism-expert-quality-manager
```
**Output:** Expert skills verified

### Session SKL-1.3: Support Skills Sync
**Scope:** Verify remaining skills
```
□ prism-error-recovery
□ prism-debugging
□ prism-tool-selector
□ prism-session-buffer
□ prism-monolith-index
□ prism-monolith-navigator
□ prism-physics-formulas
□ prism-physics-reference
□ prism-dependency-graph
□ All remaining skills
```
**Output:** All local skills verified

---

## Phase 2: Create Missing Skills (2 Sessions)

### Session SKL-2.1: Algorithm Selector
**Scope:** Create prism-algorithm-selector from ALGORITHM_REGISTRY.json
```
□ Parse ALGORITHM_REGISTRY.json (285 algorithms)
□ Create lookup interface
□ Map problem types → algorithms → PRISM engines
□ Add usage examples
□ Test with sample queries
```
**Output:** prism-algorithm-selector/SKILL.md

### Session SKL-2.2: Code Analyzer (Optional)
**Scope:** Create prism-code-analyzer for deep analysis
```
□ Define analysis types (structural, quality, patterns)
□ Create metrics calculations
□ Add refactoring suggestions
□ MIT 6.001/6.005 integration
```
**Output:** prism-code-analyzer/SKILL.md

---

## Phase 3: Enhancements (2 Sessions)

### Session SKL-3.1: State Manager Enhancement
**Scope:** Add auto-checkpoint triggers
```
□ Token count estimation
□ Tool call counting
□ Time-based triggers
□ Complexity detection
□ Delta-only updates
```
**Output:** Enhanced prism-state-manager

### Session SKL-3.2: Extractor Enhancement
**Scope:** Add pattern recognition
```
□ Automatic dependency detection
□ Code quality scoring
□ Pattern recognition
□ Pre-extraction checklist
```
**Output:** Enhanced prism-extractor

---

## Phase 4: Finalization (1 Session)

### Session SKL-4.1: Package & Verify
**Scope:** Final verification and packaging
```
□ Create SKILL_PACKAGE_v2.0.zip with all skills
□ Update PRISM_SKILLS_README.md
□ Verify all skills have SKILL.md
□ Update CURRENT_STATE.json skill counts
□ Test skill loading with view()
```
**Output:** Complete skill package ready

# CURRENT SESSION

**Starting:** SKL-1.1 - Priority Skills Sync

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Verify prism-context-dna is complete
2. Verify prism-context-pressure exists and is complete
3. Verify prism-coding-patterns exists and is complete
4. Check each priority skill for completeness
5. Note any gaps
