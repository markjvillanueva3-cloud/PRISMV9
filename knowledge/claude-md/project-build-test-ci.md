## BUILD / TEST / CI

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm run build:fast        # esbuild only (~3s) — rapid iteration
npm run build:incremental # tsc incremental + esbuild (~10s)
npm run build             # full tsc + esbuild (~30s) — pre-commit gate
npx vitest run            # all tests
npx vitest run <file>     # specific file
```
CI: `.github/workflows/` (ci.yml, deploy.yml, nightly.yml). Tests: real behavior checks — placeholder asserts are rejected by hook-stack. Workflow/routing changes must parse rendered URLs and assert concrete params.
