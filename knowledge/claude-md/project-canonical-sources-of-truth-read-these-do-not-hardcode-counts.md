## CANONICAL SOURCES OF TRUTH (READ THESE, DO NOT HARDCODE COUNTS)

| Source | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `PRISM-INVENTORY-LATEST.md` | Live auto-updated counts (engines, dispatchers, actions, hooks, scripts). Regenerated on every SessionStart. |
| `mcp-server/data/state/BASELINE_INVENTORY.json` | Schema-versioned baseline snapshot for anti-regression. |
| `mcp-server/data/docs/gsd/GSD_QUICK.md` | Session lifecycle — which hooks auto-fire on SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / Stop. |
| `mcp-server/data/docs/gsd/DEV_PROTOCOL.md` | Full dev protocol with command-bridge and shared-directive links. |
| `mcp-server/data/docs/ENGINE_DIGEST.md` | 1-line descriptions for every engine — check BEFORE creating. |
| `mcp-server/data/docs/DISPATCHER_DIGEST.md` | Dispatcher index with action counts. |
| `mcp-server/data/docs/DIRECTORY_DIGEST.md` | File-system digest (215 directories with purposes). |
| `state/shared/PRISM-SELF-AWARENESS-DIRECTIVE.md` | JM Die paths, AI capability inventory, multi-agent patterns. |
| `state/shared/PRISM_SHARED_INDEX_SURFACES.md` | Shared indexes for cross-agent search-first discipline. |

If you need a number, **read the file**. Do not rely on counts baked into this document — they rot within days.
