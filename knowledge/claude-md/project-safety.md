## SAFETY

- **NEVER inline Kienzle/Taylor/material constants** — import from `mcp-server/src/physics/constants.ts`.
- Canonical kc1.1 per ISO group: P=1800, M=2100, K=1100, N=700, S=2800, H=3200.
- NEVER create stub engines — enforcement hook blocks placeholder returns.
- Always run affected tests after engine modifications (hook suggests which).
- Always check `ENGINE_DIGEST.md` before creating new engines.
