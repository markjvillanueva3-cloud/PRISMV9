Audit PRISM galaxy #8/34: **cad**. Inspect mcp-server/src/engines/cad/{MEMORY,PATHS,TOOLBELT,CLAUDE}.md and count its real domain assets. Score it x/8 against the rubric, list the GAPS, and give the exact FILL recommendation per gap.


GOAL (operator, helping zulu): audit each of the 34 PRISM galaxies "1 by 1 in sequential order to ensure their galaxies are setup to their maximum potential." The concern: many galaxies don't have all their memories, file paths, wikis, and tribal knowledge properly mapped — each chat slot needs FULL context of its domain at all times. Use Obsidian + the Ollama/Docker local stack to fill gaps.

GROUND TRUTH (verified this session):
- A galaxy = a doctrine/index folder at mcp-server/src/engines/<galaxy>/ with 4 artifacts: CLAUDE.md (domain doctrine), MEMORY.md (per-domain brain), PATHS.md (maps the galaxy's real assets), TOOLBELT.md (the galaxy's tools/dispatchers). ALL 34 galaxies HAVE all 4 files — the question is DEPTH/COMPLETENESS, not existence.
- Engines do NOT live inside the galaxy dir — they're flat in mcp-server/src/engines/*.ts; the galaxy's PATHS.md REFERENCES them (e.g. mill PATHS.md has 58 path-refs). So "complete PATHS" = it maps the galaxy's real scattered domain assets (engines, dispatchers, wiki, tribal, corpus paths).
- Vault mirror: knowledge/memories/galaxies/<galaxy>/MEMORY.md now exists for all 34 (just filled this session).
- Wiki: knowledge/wiki/{architecture,lessons,code-tribal,concepts,...}/ — coverage is UNEVEN (wedm ~49 wiki files, speed-feed ~2). Tribal: knowledge/wiki/code-tribal/.
- Local stack: Ollama UP (:11434, models incl gpt-oss:20b/qwen2.5-coder:32b for classification/summarization), MCP :3100 UP, Qdrant DOWN (semantic_search degraded — use lexical/file search).

THE COMPLETENESS RUBRIC (score each galaxy against this — from state/shared/specs/MASTER-BRAIN-TEMPLATE.md):
A galaxy is COMPLETE iff its MEMORY.md has the 4 standing sections + the 4 connection axes, AND its PATHS/TOOLBELT map the real dom

I'll audit galaxy #8/34: **cad**. Let me start by reading the 4 artifacts and gathering ground-truth on the domain's real assets.
