{"assessment":"## PRISM F2 Cross-Session Memory Graph v3 Assessment\n\n### 1. Letter Grade: **B+**\n\n### 2. Component Scores:\n- **R (Reasoning): 85** - Well-structured graph model with appropriate node types and clear separation from control systems\n- **C (Code): 82** - Solid TypeScript interfaces, atomic operations, but missing some production hardening details\n- **P (Process): 88** - Good WAL implementation, integrity checks, and monitoring approach\n- **S (Safety): 90** - Excellent fail-safe design with complete operational independence from CNC control\n- **L (Learning): 78** - Shows improvement from v2, but documentation gaps remain\n\n### 3. **Ω(x) = 86.05**\n- 0.25(85) + 0.20(82) + 0.15(88) + 0.30(90) + 0.10(78) = 86.05\n\n### 4. Production Readiness: **CONDITIONAL**\n\n### 5. Key Findings and Recommendations:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Excellent Safety Architecture** - Clear separation from CNC control with zero operational impact on failure\n2. **Robust Failure Handling** - Comprehensive failure mode table with specific mitigations\n3. **Atomic Operations** - WAL implementation ensures data consistency across multi-file operations\n4. **Performance Targets** - Well-defined SLOs appropriate for enhancement layer\n\n**Critical Issues to Address:**\n\n1. **Memory Management Concerns:**\n   - 10MB for 100K nodes seems optimistic (100 bytes/node including indexes)\n   - Need explicit memory pressure handling and eviction policies\n   - Recommendation: Implement tiered storage with hot/cold separation\n\n2. **Concurrency Control:**\n   - No mention of concurrent access handling\n   - WAL needs explicit locking strategy\n   - Recommendation: Document and implement read-write lock patterns\n\n3. **Recovery Time Objectives:**\n   - Index rebuild at 10s for 50K nodes may impact availability\n   - Recommendation: Implement incremental index updates or parallel rebuild\n\n4. **Testing Gaps:**\n   - No mention of chaos testing or failure injection\n   - Recommendation: Implement failure injection framework for all 7 failure modes\n\n**Production Readiness Requirements:**\n\n1. **Immediate (P0):**\n   - Add explicit concurrency control documentation and implementation\n   - Implement memory pressure monitoring and automatic pruning\n   - Add distributed lock for WAL operations if multi-instance deployment planned\n\n2. **Near-term (P1):**\n   - Implement incremental index updates to avoid full rebuilds\n   - Add chaos testing suite covering all failure modes\n   - Create runbook for each failure scenario\n\n3. **Monitoring Enhancements:**\n   - Add memory usage by node type metrics\n   - Track WAL replay duration on recovery\n   - Monitor index staleness during high write periods\n\n**Recommendation:** \nApprove for staged production deployment with:\n- Phase 1: Single dispatcher pilot with intensive monitoring\n- Phase 2: Gradual rollout after addressing P0 items\n- Phase 3: Full deployment after 30-day stability demonstration\n\nThe safety-first architecture and operational independence make this suitable for production with appropriate safeguards. The improvement from v2 (Ω=80.4 to 86.05) shows positive trajectory.","timestamp":"2026-02-09T17:20:10.949Z","model":"claude-opus-4-20250514"}
