The architecture correctly focuses on data integrity and operator assistance rather than attempting to implement hardware safety controls. With the completion of integration testing and operational tooling, this system will provide valuable manufacturing intelligence while maintaining appropriate safety boundaries.\n\nThe previous validator's safety concerns appear to stem from misunderstanding the system's role. PRISM appropriately handles safety through data correctness, anomaly detection, and operator alerting—exactly what a software orchestration layer should provide.","timestamp":"2026-02-09T17:07:38.092Z","model":"claude-opus-4-20250514"}
