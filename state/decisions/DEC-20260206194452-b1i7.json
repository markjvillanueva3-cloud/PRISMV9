  "decision": "Ralph_loop model string fix is a stale action item — no hardcoded model strings found anywhere in MCP server src/ or dist/. No .env file exists. No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY references. The ralph_loop tool likely uses runtime config from claude_desktop_config.json env section, not embedded strings.",
  "alternatives": [
    "Search was thorough: checked src/, dist/, all file types for claude-haiku, claude-sonnet, model strings, 20241022, ANTHROPIC, API_KEY",
