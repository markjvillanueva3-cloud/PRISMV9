          "findings": "## Code Review Findings: PRISM MCP Dispatcher Telemetry System\n\n### CRITICAL Issues\n\n1. **Race Condition in MetricsAggregator Timer vs Dispatcher Writes**\n   - Lock-free ring buffers don't guarantee atomicity of multi-field records (start_time, end_time, outcome, etc.)\n   - 1-second timer could read partially written metrics during high-frequency writes\n   - **Fix**: Use atomic write operations or single-write slots with sequence numbers\n\n2. **Memory Leak in Rolling Windows**\n   - No explicit cleanup mechanism for expired time window data\n   - 24-hour windows with 299 actions could accumulate unbounded data\n   - **Fix**: Implement explicit cleanup with configurable retention limits\n\n3. **Catastrophic Failure on Snapshot Corruption**\n   - \"fault-tolerant init with empty metrics\" loses all historical baselines\n   - AnomalyDetector requires 1-hour baseline but starts with empty state\n   - **Fix**: Multiple snapshot versions + gradual baseline rebuilding\n\n### HIGH Priority Issues\n\n4. **Inadequate Error Boundary in InstrumentationWrapper**\n   - No exception handling specified for wrapper operations\n   - Single wrapper failure could cascade to dispatcher failure\n   - Missing timeout protection for metrics collection itself\n\n5. **AnomalyDetector Statistical Flaws**\n   - 2σ threshold assumes normal distribution (manufacturing latency often isn't)\n   - No handling for seasonal patterns or planned maintenance windows\n   - Cold start problem: insufficient data for meaningful baselines\n\n6. **RouteOptimizer Convergence Issues**\n   - 15% weight change could still cause oscillation with multiple correlated dispatchers\n   - No deadlock prevention if all dispatchers become unhealthy\n   - Missing fallback when optimization degrades overall performance\n\n### MEDIUM Priority Issues\n\n7. **Token Estimation Accuracy Problems**\n   - \"Calibration action\" approach undefined - how/when does calibration occur?\n   - No handling of token model changes or different action types having different token costs\n\n8. **Insufficient Queue Depth Monitoring**\n   - Queue depth recorded but no overflow detection or backpressure mechanisms\n   - No correlation between queue depth and performance degradation thresholds\n\n9. **TelemetryAPI Security Gap**\n   - New dispatcher with system metrics access but no authentication/authorization mentioned\n   - Could expose sensitive manufacturing data or enable DoS via expensive queries\n\n### LOW Priority Issues\n\n10. **Missing Graceful Degradation**\n    - No circuit breaker pattern when telemetry system itself fails\n    - Should continue core operations even if metrics collection breaks\n\n11. **Limited Observability of Telemetry System**\n    - No self-monitoring of instrumentation overhead\n    - No metrics on metrics system performance\n\n12. **Configuration Inflexibility**\n    - Hard-coded thresholds (2σ, 15%, 60s cycles) should be configurable\n    - No environment-specific tuning (development vs production)\n\n### Additional Edge Cases\n\n- **Clock Synchronization**: No handling of system clock adjustments affecting time-based metrics\n- **Dispatcher Hot-Swapping**: No consideration for adding/removing dispatchers at runtime\n- **Burst Traffic Patterns**: Minimum 5 calls threshold might miss rapid anomalies in bursty workloads\n- **Cross-Dispatcher Dependencies**: Optimization doesn't account for dispatcher interdependencies\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. Implement atomic metrics recording with memory barriers\n2. Add comprehensive error handling with circuit breakers\n3. Use percentile-based anomaly detection instead of standard deviation\n4. Implement gradual baseline recovery for cold starts\n5. Add authentication to TelemetryAPI endpoints\n6. Include telemetry system health monitoring\n\n### SCORE: 0.65\n\n**Rationale**: Good architectural concepts with serious implementation gaps. The lock-free ring buffer approach is promising but needs atomic guarantees. Statistical anomaly detection needs refinement for manufacturing environments. Critical path safety is maintained but telemetry reliability is questionable. Requires significant hardening before production deployment in safety-critical CNC systems.",
