Component Scores (0.00–1.00 scale)\n\n| Component | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **R (Reasoning)** | 0.82 | The \"Enhancement-In-Place\" strategy reflects sound architectural reasoning — upgrading existing infrastructure rather than risky rip-and-replace. Version 11.0 implies iterative maturation. However, the submitted artifact is a roadmap title and validator list only; the underlying reasoning chain, decision rationale, trade-off analysis, and dependency mapping are **not included** in the assessment payload, which limits full scoring. |\n| **C (Code)** | 0.70 | No code artifacts, configuration snippets, migration scripts, or schema definitions were provided for review. CODE_REVIEWER validator is listed but its output/findings are absent. Score reflects credit for invoking the validator but penalizes the lack of transparent review evidence. |\n| **P (Process)** | 0.78 | Three validators (SAFETY_AUDITOR, CODE_REVIEWER, COMPLETENESS_CHECKER) demonstrate a structured multi-gate validation pipeline — a strong process signal. Deductions: no evidence of validation outputs, no sign-off records, no change-control or rollback procedures documented, and no stakeholder approval matrix visible. |\n| **S (Safety)** | 0.75 | SAFETY_AUDITOR is listed, which is critical and appropriate. However, safety findings, risk register entries, threat model references, failure-mode analysis, and mitigation plans are entirely absent from the submission. Enhancement-In-Place inherently carries lower blast radius than greenfield, which earns baseline credit. Without actual audit output, full marks are unwarranted. |\n| **L (Learning)** | 0.68 | Version 11.0 implies significant iteration history and organizational learning. However, no retrospective data, lessons-learned artifacts, regression tracking, or feedback loop documentation was provided. The learning score is inferred, not evidenced. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ω(x) Composite Score\n\n$$\\Omega(x) = 0.25(0.82) + 0.20(0.70) + 0.15(0.78) + 0.30(0.75) + 0.10(0.68)$$\n\n| Term | Calculation |\n|------|-------------|\n| 0.25 × R | 0.2050 |\n| 0.20 × C | 0.1400 |\n| 0.15 × P | 0.1170 |\n| 0.30 × S | 0.2250 |\n| 0.10 × L | 0.0680 |\n| **Ω(x)** | **0.7550** |\n\n### **Ω(x) = 0.755**\n\n*Interpretation: Above-average quality posture, but below the 0.85 threshold typically required for unconditional production release.*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Production Readiness Verdict\n\n# ⚠️ CONDITIONAL\n\n**Conditions that MUST be satisfied before READY status:**\n\n| # | Condition | Priority | Owner Action Required |\n|---|-----------|----------|----------------------|\n| 1 | Publish full SAFETY_AUDITOR output with risk register and mitigations | **CRITICAL** | Attach audit report with signed findings |\n| 2 | Provide CODE_REVIEWER findings — identified issues, severity, resolution status | **CRITICAL** | Include diff-level review artifacts |\n| 3 | Attach COMPLETENESS_CHECKER output confirming all roadmap sections scored ≥ 90% | **HIGH** | Provide gap analysis matrix |\n| 4 | Document rollback/back-out plan for Enhancement-In-Place execution | **CRITICAL** | Include RTO/RPO targets and tested rollback scripts |\n| 5 | Include stakeholder sign-off matrix with dates and authority levels | **HIGH** | Provide RACI + approval chain |\n| 6 | Provide version delta (v10.x → v11.0) with change justification log | **MEDIUM** | Attach changelog with traceability IDs |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Findings and Recommendations\n\n### ✅ Strengths\n- **Enhancement-In-Place** is a mature, risk-conscious strategy that preserves operational continuity — architecturally sound choice\n- **Triple-validator pipeline** (Safety, Code, Completeness) demonstrates defense-in-depth quality posture\n- **Version 11.0** signals a sustained, disciplined iteration lifecycle\n\n### 🔴 Critical Gaps\n1. **Evidence vacuum**: Validators are declared but their outputs are entirely absent — this is a **documentation-level audit failure**. Validators without visible findings provide zero assurance value.\n2. **Safety opacity**: The highest-weighted component (S = 0.30) rests on a validator name alone. No threat models, FMEA, or residual risk acceptance documented.\n3. **No rollback plan visible**: Enhancement-In-Place without a documented reversion strategy is an existential operational risk.\n\n### 🟡 Recommendations\n| Priority | Recommendation |\n|----------|---------------|\n| **Immediate** | Re-submit with all three validator output reports attached as appendices |\n| **Immediate** | Add rollback procedure with tested recovery playbook |\n| **Short-term** | Create traceability matrix linking each roadmap item to validator coverage |\n| **Short-term** | Establish Ω(x) ≥ 0.85 as the formal go/no-go gate in your release pipeline |\n| **Ongoing** | Archive v10 → v11 delta with lessons-learned to boost L-score in future assessments |\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary\n\n> PRISM v11.0 shows **strong strategic intent and process scaffolding**, but the submission as evaluated is a **skeleton without evidence**. The validators are the right ones; their outputs simply need to be made visible. Closing the six conditions above would likely elevate Ω(x) to the **0.85–0.90 range** and unlock unconditional **READY** status.\n\n**Assessor Confidence Level:** Medium (limited by artifact completeness)\n**Reassessment Recommended:** Yes — upon condition satisfaction",
