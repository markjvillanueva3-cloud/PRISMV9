Got it — that's the compaction artifact showing my prior work completed successfully. The full brainstorm is already written at C:\PRISM\mcp-server\data\docs\roadmap\BRAINSTORM_R12_R14.md. Let me commit it.


Marshaled substantial code and prepared concise briefing
Marshaled substantial code and prepared concise briefing


Committed. 1,720 lines at data/docs/roadmap/BRAINSTORM_R12_R14.md.

What's in it:

Part 1 — 22 improvements found across P0→R11:

IMP-P0-1→3: Phantom skills, hook telemetry, AutoPilot tracing
IMP-DA-1→3: CC_DEFERRED backlog (13 items), 28 orphan scripts, empty skill triggers
IMP-R1-1→3: Material coverage gaps, tool validation, alarm dual-path
IMP-R2-1→2: Rz physics, stability lobe diagrams
IMP-R3-1→3: IntelligenceEngine 85KB monolith, cost calc limits, GD&T gaps
IMP-R4-1→2: Only 5/382 REST endpoints, no log rotation
IMP-R7/R10: 257 extracted engines unclassified, 3 engines >50KB
IMP-XC-1→3: No unified test coverage, build size unchecked, zero JSDoc
Part 2 — Three new phases with full PHASE_TEMPLATE.md compliance:

Phase	Sessions	Milestones	Focus
R12	6-8	8 (MS0-MS7)	Dev infra: CC hooks, skill triggers, engine splits, test infra, integration pipeline
R13	8-12	7 (MS0-MS6)	Monolith extraction: 7 intelligence engines (~27K lines), 257-file audit
R14	12-16	9 (MS0-MS8)	Products: Post Processor, Quoting, Process Planning, Troubleshooter, catalog parsing
Part 3 — Summary: Task DAGs, role/model/effort matrix for all 24 milestones, parallel opportunities, deferred items with rationale, and every improvement mapped to its target milestone.

Dev tools first as requested — R12 cleans house before R13/R14 build on it.

did you already compose the new roadmap?

Assessed whether formal roadmap files were previously generated
Assessed whether formal roadmap files were previously generated

No — I wrote the brainstorm document only. The formal phase files don't exist yet:

❌ PHASE_R12_INFRASTRUCTURE.md
❌ PHASE_R13_EXTRACTION.md
❌ PHASE_R14_PRODUCTS.md
The brainstorm has all the content to generate them. Want me to convert them into proper phase files matching the existing format (like R1-R11), update the roadmap index, and wire them into the tracker?

yes, be comprehensive and highly detailed following the same format as the existing modular road map. merge this roadmap with the current one. DO NOT LOSE INFORMATION! reorganize and repriortize the exist work left. prioritize development tools first.

Now I have the full format. Let me build all three phase files + update the index. This will be a large multi-file write.
