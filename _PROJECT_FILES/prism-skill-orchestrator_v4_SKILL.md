LEVEL 0: ABSOLUTE LAWS (Never Override) - ALWAYS ACTIVE
├── Life-Safety Mindset: Thoroughness saves lives
├── Maximum Completeness: 100% theoretical/mathematical/statistical
├── Anti-Regression: Never lose content in replacements
└── The 10 Commandments: IF IT EXISTS, USE IT EVERYWHERE

LEVEL 1: THINKING PATTERNS (Always Apply) - ALWAYS ACTIVE
├── Predictive Thinking: Think ahead, prevent, prepare
└── Skill Orchestrator: Integration (THIS)

LEVEL 2: SUPERPOWERS WORKFLOW (Execution Order)
└── BRAINSTORM → PLANNING → EXECUTION → REVIEW-SPEC → REVIEW-QUALITY → HANDOFF
         ↑                                     ↓

# SESSION CHECKLISTS

## Start
```
□ Read CURRENT_STATE.json
□ Check IN_PROGRESS? → Resume, don't restart
□ Always-on skills auto-active (Level 0-1)
□ Load phase-appropriate skills
□ Buffer counter = 0
```

## Pre-Task (4 Laws Check)
```
□ SAFETY: What physical outcome depends on correctness?
□ COMPLETENESS: What is 100% for this task?
□ REGRESSION: Am I replacing something? → Inventory first
□ PREDICTION: 3 most likely failure modes?
```

## Checkpoint (Yellow Buffer 9-14 calls)
```
□ Tasks completed: X of Y
□ Evidence: file listings, content samples
□ CURRENT_STATE.json updated
□ quickResume written
```

## End
```
□ CURRENT_STATE.json fully updated
□ quickResume with DOING/STOPPED/NEXT
□ Handoff notes documented
□ No partial implementations
```

| Buffer vs Quality | **Quality** (checkpoint, resume) |
| Domain vs Mindset | **Mindset** |
| Old vs New skill | **Newer SP version** |
