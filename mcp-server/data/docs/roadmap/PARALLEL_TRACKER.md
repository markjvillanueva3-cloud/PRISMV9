# PARALLEL EXECUTION TRACKER
# Used when multiple milestones run concurrently (e.g., R1 MS5+MS6+MS7 via Git worktrees)
# Update this file when starting/completing parallel work streams.
# Location: C:\PRISM\mcp-server\data\docs\roadmap\PARALLEL_TRACKER.md

## FORMAT
# STREAM | MS | STATUS | WORKTREE | LAST_UPDATE | NOTES
# Each stream is an independent parallel work unit.

## ACTIVE PARALLEL STREAMS
(none active)

## COMPLETED PARALLEL STREAMS
(none yet)

## RULES
# 1. Before starting parallel work: register all streams here
# 2. After completing a stream: mark COMPLETE with date
# 3. ALL streams must complete before advancing to next sequential milestone
# 4. If one stream blocks another: note the dependency here
# 5. Merge order: complete streams merge to main in dependency order
