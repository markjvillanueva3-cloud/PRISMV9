## D4: PERFORMANCE & CACHING ✅ COMPLETE
TypeScript Engines (ALL live in dispatch loop):
- ComputationCache (421L): CRC32-keyed, 3 tiers (SAFETY=30s, STANDARD=120s, STABLE=300s), LRU eviction, dependency-graph cascade invalidation. Safety calcs ALWAYS bypass cache.
- DiffEngine (197L): CRC32 checksum diff, shadow-write (.tmp→validate→swap), tracks skipped writes.
- BatchProcessor (234L): Priority queue (CRITICAL=immediate, HIGH/NORMAL/LOW=batched), fail-fast isolation.

Cadence Auto-Fire:
- autoD4CacheCheck @15 calls — cleanup expired, log stats
- autoD4DiffCheck @15 calls — persist diff statistics
- autoD4BatchTick @8 calls — process queued operations

Note: Python counterparts exist (computation_cache.py 802L, diff_based_updates.py 908L, batch_processor.py 457L) but TypeScript engines are used instead. Python versions remain available for offline/batch processing.

Success Criteria:
- Cache hit rate >30% on repeated calculations
- Redundant writes eliminated via DiffEngine
- Batch queue drains within 2 ticks

## Changelog
- 2026-02-10: v2.0 — File-based. Noted Python counterparts exist but TS engines are primary.
