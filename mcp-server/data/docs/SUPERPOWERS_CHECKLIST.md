# SUPERPOWERS CHECKLIST — Mandatory MS Gates
# Brainstorm → Plan → Execute → Review(spec) → Review(quality) → Verify

## PRE-MS GATE (before starting any milestone)
- [ ] Plan documented (what, why, how, estimated calls)
- [ ] Approach reviewed (is this the right approach? alternatives considered?)
- [ ] Dependencies checked (what must be true before starting?)
- [ ] Role/Model/Effort confirmed from roadmap

## POST-MS GATE (after completing any milestone)
- [ ] Deliverables exist on disk (not just in context)
- [ ] Spec review: Does output match the roadmap specification?
- [ ] Quality review: Is output complete, correct, no placeholders?
- [ ] Evidence collected: What proves this works? (build pass, test results, verification)
- [ ] Position files updated: CURRENT_POSITION.md, ROADMAP_TRACKER.md
- [ ] TIME_SAVED_PER_SESSION estimate recorded
- [ ] Handoff written: SESSION_HANDOFF.md updated

## SAFETY-CRITICAL ADDITIONS (R2+ phases)
- [ ] S(x) >= 0.70 verified for any calc changes
- [ ] Ralph validation run at appropriate depth (see RALPH_SCHEDULE.md)
- [ ] Anti-regression check passed

## USAGE
Check items as you go. Skip items marked N/A for lightened milestones.
This checklist is ADVISORY, not blocking — but skipping items accumulates debt.
