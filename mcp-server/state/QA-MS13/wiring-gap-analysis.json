  "verdict": "PASS WITH NOTES - 920 case-statement actions found across 45 dispatchers. Dispatcher-to-function (D2F) wiring is dense with switch/case routing. The claimed 86% gap was based on early QA-MS0 baseline using action-count-to-engine ratios — actual wiring via switch/case is comprehensive.",
