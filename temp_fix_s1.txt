**CONVERGENCE HOOK:**
```
coupled_physics_convergence — blocking, post-calculation
  Checks: did the iterative solver converge?
  If iterations > 20 or residual > threshold → BLOCK result
  WALL-CLOCK TIMEOUT (v14.5 — S-1 safety fix):
    30-second hard timeout on ALL coupled physics iterations.
    If not converged in 30s → return SAFETY_BLOCK with message:
      "Physics model did not converge within 30s. Use conservative handbook values."
    WHY: Without timeout, numerical instability could hang indefinitely.
    During hang, operator might use manual parameters (could be wrong).
    Timeout ensures system ALWAYS returns a definitive answer.
    Implementation: wrap iterative solver in Promise.race([solver, timeout(30000)])
  Log: convergence_iterations, residual, which coupling was slowest, wall_clock_ms
coupled_physics_divergence_alert — warning
  If sensitivity analysis shows >50% output change for <5% input change → ALERT
  Indicates numerically unstable regime — recommend different parameters
