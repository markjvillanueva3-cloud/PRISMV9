I cannot find a complete JavaScript definition of `PRISM_RIGID_BODY_DYNAMICS_ENGINE` in the provided contexts. The contexts only show:

1. A reference to it being registered to `window.PRISM_RIGID_BODY_DYNAMICS_ENGINE`
2. Mentions of it in console logs and comments
3. A truncated line that appears to be part of the registration

The actual definition/implementation of `PRISM_RIGID_BODY_DYNAMICS_ENGINE` is not present in the provided code contexts.
