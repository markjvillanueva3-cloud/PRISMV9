# PRISM Development Skill (Master Reference)

> ⚡ **FOR QUICK SESSION START:** Read `prism-quick-start` instead (100 lines vs this full reference)

## Claude's Role
Claude is the **PRIMARY DEVELOPER** of PRISM Manufacturing Intelligence v9.0 rebuild.

## The 10 Commandments
1. **IF IT EXISTS, USE IT EVERYWHERE** - 100% utilization
2. **FUSE THE UNFUSABLE** - Cross-domain concepts
3. **TRUST BUT VERIFY** - Physics + empirical + historical
4. **LEARN FROM EVERYTHING** - Every interaction feeds learning
5. **PREDICT WITH UNCERTAINTY** - Confidence intervals on outputs
6. **EXPLAIN EVERYTHING** - XAI on all recommendations
7. **FAIL GRACEFULLY** - Fallbacks everywhere
8. **PROTECT EVERYTHING** - Validate, sanitize, encrypt, backup
9. **PERFORM ALWAYS** - <2s page, <500ms calc
10. **OBSESS OVER USERS** - 3-click rule

## 🔴 OPTIMIZED SESSION START (NEW)

**Instead of reading 5+ skills, read ONE:**
```
1. Read prism-quick-start (100 lines, all essential info)
2. Read CURRENT_STATE.json quickResume section
3. Execute
```

**Only read full skills when needed for complex tasks.**

## Critical Paths

```
STATE:    C:\PRISM REBUILD (UPLOAD TO BOX OCCASSIONALLY)\CURRENT_STATE.json
MONOLITH: C:\PRISM REBUILD (UPLOAD TO BOX OCCASSIONALLY)\_BUILD\PRISM_v8_89_002_TRUE_100_PERCENT\PRISM_v8_89_002_TRUE_100_PERCENT.html
EXTRACT:  C:\PRISM REBUILD (UPLOAD TO BOX OCCASSIONALLY)\EXTRACTED\
SKILLS:   C:\PRISM REBUILD (UPLOAD TO BOX OCCASSIONALLY)\_SKILLS\  (or /mnt/skills/user/)
```

## Tool Selection (Quick Reference)

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Read C: files | `Filesystem:read_file` |
| Write C: files | `Filesystem:write_file` |
| Read large files | `Desktop Commander:read_file` + offset/length |
| Search content | `Desktop Commander:start_search` searchType:"content" |
| Read skills | `view` /mnt/skills/user/... |

## Anti-Restart Protocol

```
❌ NEVER restart mid-task
❌ NEVER re-read files already in context
❌ NEVER pivot to "figure out how" mid-task
✅ CHECKPOINT → CONTINUE → COMPLETE
✅ Read skills BEFORE starting (not during)
```

## Module Index (500+ Pre-Indexed)

Key modules with verified line numbers:
| Module | Line |

| PRISM_GATEWAY | 11,888 |
| PRISM_KNOWLEDGE_BASE | 101,390 |
| PRISM_TOOL_DATABASE_V7 | 467,398 |
| PRISM_MATERIALS_MASTER | 611,225 |
