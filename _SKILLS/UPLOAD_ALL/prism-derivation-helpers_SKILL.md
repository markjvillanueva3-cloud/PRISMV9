> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED:** This skill has been merged into `prism-physics-formulas`
> Use `prism-physics-formulas` for all property derivations

## Why Deprecated

1. **Consolidation:** All physics derivations now in one skill
2. **MIT Foundation:** prism-physics-formulas includes academic backing
3. **Complete Coverage:** 127 parameters all derivable from one skill

## Consumers (Historical)

These modules previously used derivation-helpers:
- PRISM_MATERIALS_MASTER → Now uses physics-formulas
- Material creation workflow → Uses templates + formulas
- PRISM_AI_LEARNING_PIPELINE → Direct formula access
