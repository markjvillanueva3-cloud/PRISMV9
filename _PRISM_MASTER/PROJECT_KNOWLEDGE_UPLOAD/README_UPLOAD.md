# PRISM PROJECT KNOWLEDGE - CLEAN UPLOAD
## Upload Instructions

---

## DELETE EVERYTHING FROM YOUR CLAUDE PROJECT

Go to Claude Project Settings → Project Knowledge → Remove ALL files

---

## UPLOAD THESE FILES (IN ORDER)

### REQUIRED (1 file):
1. **PRISM_COMPLETE_SYSTEM_v8.md** (21KB) - The complete prompt with all automation

### OPTIONAL (for detailed reference):
2. **00_CONDENSED_PROTOCOL_v8.md** (5KB) - Quick reference card

That's it! Just 1-2 files instead of 96.

---

## WHY ONLY 1-2 FILES?

The **PRISM_COMPLETE_SYSTEM_v8.md** already contains:
- ✅ All 6 Always-On Laws (condensed)
- ✅ Mandatory Microsession Framework
- ✅ 38 Skill References  
- ✅ 56 Agent Definitions
- ✅ Tool Quick Reference
- ✅ Buffer Zones & Checkpoints
- ✅ Emergency Procedures
- ✅ Auto-Skill Loading Keywords
- ✅ Self-Improvement Protocol
- ✅ Predictive Auto-Triggers

The detailed Level 0 skills (~100KB) are available on your C: drive at:
`_SKILLS\` - Claude can read these when needed via Filesystem tools.

---

## WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PYTHON SCRIPTS?

Python scripts (.py files) should NOT be in Project Knowledge.
They stay on your C: drive at:
- `_PRISM_MASTER\SCRIPTS\` - Orchestrators, generators, validators
- Claude runs them via `Desktop Commander:start_process`

---

## AFTER UPLOAD

Start a new chat and Claude will automatically:
1. Read CURRENT_STATE.json
2. Quote the quickResume
3. Decompose tasks into microsessions
4. Run predictive analysis before operations
5. Checkpoint at buffer zones

No manual prompting needed!
