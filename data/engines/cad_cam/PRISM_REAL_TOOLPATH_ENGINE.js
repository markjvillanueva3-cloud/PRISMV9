I don't see the complete definition of `PRISM_REAL_TOOLPATH_ENGINE` in the provided code. The code shows various other components (PRISM_CONSTANTS, PRISM_UNITS, PRISM_GATEWAY, PRISM_VALIDATOR) and references to `PRISM_REAL_TOOLPATH_ENGINE` in the PRISM_GATEWAY authorities section:

```javascript
'toolpath.generate': { module: 'PRISM_REAL_TOOLPATH_ENGINE', method: 'generate' },
```

But the actual definition/implementation of `PRISM_REAL_TOOLPATH_ENGINE` is not included in the provided code context.
