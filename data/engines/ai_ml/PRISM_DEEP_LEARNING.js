Looking through the contexts, I cannot find a complete JavaScript definition of `PRISM_DEEP_LEARNING`. 

The contexts contain:
- `PRISM_DEEP_LEARNING_PARAMS` (a different object with deep learning hyperparameters)
- Various other PRISM objects like `PRISM_TIME_LOOKUP`, `PRISM_SAFETY_LOOKUP`, etc.

But there is no definition that matches any of these patterns:
- `class PRISM_DEEP_LEARNING { ... }`
- `const PRISM_DEEP_LEARNING = { ... }`
- `function PRISM_DEEP_LEARNING() { ... }`

The object `PRISM_DEEP_LEARNING` does not exist in the provided contexts.
