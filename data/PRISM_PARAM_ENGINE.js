I don't see the complete JavaScript definition of `PRISM_PARAM_ENGINE` in the provided contexts. The contexts only show references to `PRISM_PARAM_ENGINE` being used (like `PRISM_PARAM_ENGINE.autoAdjustEnabled` and `PRISM_PARAM_ENGINE.autoAdjustParameters()`), but not the actual definition of the class, object, or function itself.

The contexts appear to be cut off and only show initialization code that references `PRISM_PARAM_ENGINE`, but not where it's actually defined.
